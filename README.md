### Summary

This project seeks to determine if whale movement along the California Coast have changed between 1999 and 2008, and if said changes are correlated to environmental factors like sea-surface temperature.

### Objective/Question

* Map the migration patterns in years 1999 & 2008.

* Has the migration patterns of Blue whales changed between 1999 and 2008?
  If so, by what distance?

* What is the average sea surface temperature of the migration sites.

* Has the average sea-surface temperatures of the sites changed between 1999-2008? If so, how much?

* If the migration sites have changed, what are the current water temperatures of the new sites, and how do they compare to the orignal temperatures of the 1999 sites? Are they similar/correlated?

* How do the current temperatures of the new sites compare to current temeratures at the original sites?

* Does sea surface temperature indicate any correlation to whale migration patterns?

* Other Environmental factors to consider?

### Package Requirements Include

* jupyter
* seaborn
* matplotlib
* pandas
* scikit-learn
* geopandas
* numpy
* shapely
* osmnx
* networkx
* rioxarray
* selenium
* bs4
* descartes
* momepy
* folium

 All required packeges can be installed using: `pip install requirements.txt`

### Planned methods/approach

1. Isolate the years of interest from both datasets

2. Calculate the mean water temperature for years of interest isolated by winter vs summer.

3. Locate whale movement and plot.

4. Create change map for temperature.

5. Find locations and cooresponding temperature changes.

6. Calculate whale displacement distance.

### Expected outcomes

We expect to see slight changes in migration patterns, perhaps to the west where deeper, cooler, water is located as average sea-surface temerature changes. We also expect to see minor temperature changes off the coast of California between these years. This year span is small so only minor changes are expected. However, if there is a trend, even if it is small we may expect this to continue. The new migration sites may have sea-surface temperatures similar to the original sites in 1993.
